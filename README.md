# Analyzing-the-Zeus-Banking-Trojan

Description 

This project guides you through setting up a secure virtual environment for analyzing malicious software, specifically the notorious Zeus Banking Trojan. By establishing a Windows VM with analysis tools and a REMnux distribution, you'll gain practical experience in static analysis, dynamic analysis, network monitoring, and rule-based detection to understand the malware's behavior and impact. Perfect for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in hands-on malware analysis.

<h2>Analyzing the Zeus Banking Trojan</h2>

For this part, we will be analyzing the Zeus banking trojan. First, some background information - basically what happened, and we will be overviewing the analysis tools. Then we go and dissect our malware, provision our lab, and conduct our analysis, which includes downloading the Trojan, labeling the malware, and going through basic static and dynamic analysis with reporting and indicators of compromise.

<h3>Background Information: Zeus Banking Trojan</h3>

The Zeus Banking Trojan, also known as Zbot, is a notorious piece of malware designed to steal banking information. First discovered in 2007, Zeus is known for its stealth and persistence, allowing it to remain undetected while capturing sensitive data such as banking credentials and credit card information through techniques like keylogging and form grabbing.

Zeus often operates as part of a botnet, controlled by a central command server, and is capable of performing man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks, intercepting and manipulating online transactions in real-time.

<b>Infection Vectors</b>

- Phishing Emails: Malicious attachments or links in emails.
- Drive-by Downloads: Automatic downloads from compromised websites.
- Social Engineering: Convincing users to download and execute the malware.

<b>Impact</b>

Zeus has caused significant financial losses globally, affecting both individuals and large organizations. Despite numerous law enforcement efforts to dismantle Zeus botnets, variants of this malware continue to emerge, highlighting its resilience.

<b>Defense Strategies</b>

- Endpoint Protection: Use robust antivirus and anti-malware solutions.
- Network Security: Monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
- User Education: Raise awareness about phishing and safe browsing practices.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enhance security for online banking.
- Regular Updates: Keep systems and software up-to-date with security patches.
By understanding the Zeus Trojan's characteristics and infection methods, we can better prepare to defend against and analyze this persistent threat.

Tools for Analyzing Zeus Banking Trojan
1. VirusTotal
VirusTotal is an online service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses and other types of malicious content. It aggregates results from multiple antivirus engines to provide a comprehensive analysis.

Example Usage:

import requests

file_path = 'path_to_file'
api_key = 'your_api_key'

with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    response = requests.post(
        'https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files',
        headers={'x-apikey': api_key},
        files={'file': file}
    )

print(response.json())
2. PeStudio
PeStudio is a tool for static analysis of Windows executables. It provides information about the file's hashes, entropy, imports, and potential indicators of malicious behavior.

3. FLOSS
FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver) extracts obfuscated strings from malware, which can reveal hidden commands, URLs, and other useful data.

4. Capa
Capa is an open-source tool that analyzes the capabilities of malicious programs by identifying behaviors and functionalities within the code.

5. Cutter
Cutter is an advanced, open-source GUI for the Rizin reverse engineering framework, used for disassembling and analyzing malware.

6. INetSim
INetSim is a tool that simulates various internet services to analyze malware's network behavior in a controlled environment.

7. Wireshark
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects packets in real-time, useful for analyzing the network traffic generated by malware.

8. Procmon
Procmon (Process Monitor) is a Windows tool that provides real-time file system, registry, and process/thread activity monitoring.

9. YARA
YARA is a tool used to identify and classify malware by creating rules that look for specific characteristics.

Example YARA Rule:

rule ZeusBankingTrojan
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects Zeus Banking Trojan samples"
    strings:
        $string1 = "Zeus"
        $string2 = { 6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91 }
    condition:
        $string1 or $string2
}
Example Usage:
